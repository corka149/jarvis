Could not find Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers imported in lib/jarvis_web.ex.

This typically happens because your application was not generated
with the --live flag:

    mix phx.new my_app --live

Please make sure LiveView is installed and that JarvisWeb
defines both `live_view/0` and `live_component/0` functions,
and that both functions import JarvisWeb.LiveHelpers.


Add the live routes to your browser scope in lib/jarvis_web/router.ex:

    live "/isles", IsleLive.Index, :index
    live "/isles/new", IsleLive.Index, :new
    live "/isles/:id/edit", IsleLive.Index, :edit

    live "/isles/:id", IsleLive.Show, :show
    live "/isles/:id/show/edit", IsleLive.Show, :edit
